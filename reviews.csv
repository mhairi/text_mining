Now it lags all the time, making it difficult to play.

22,1,"us"," Not worth your time! A Joke!  This casino just keeps getting worse. You can buy millions and be lucky if it last a day. You don't get much in free coins. They took the Extra Button off so at times you can't get the free coins offered. Worthless Casino!  Most comments on their Facebook page are from upset people. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !"

36,5,"us"," Very fun Nice graphic tons of fun"
37,1,"au"," Need cash to compete. If you not prepared to spend thousands, don't bother.  Your outcome depends on how much you spend, which determines how strong you get. 

You can try the alternative and play without spending. It'll take you over a year to build the same power level and spender can make in 10 minutes. 

Members in my alliance and other alliances spend at least $200 daily per person. Generally the bigger ones will spend over $1000 every few days. 

It takes around $1000 to get to power level of 10 million. 
And 10 mill power is small fry.  Most are over 200 mill depending on how old the kingdom is. Generally a 2 month old kingdom has players over 220 mill power and average player is over 15 mill. 

So if you have money, this is an awesome game. Graphics are cool. Loads to do."
38,5,"gb"," Wortha down load Decent game"

40,5,"us"," Hay day suggestion I have a suggestion for the trees once they die, if we could possibly use the wood for handles, and melt iron down in the metals, and maybe we could get a ""wood shop"" and we could build our own axes/saws etc.....or a ""wood chipper"" something to assist us in breaking down all of the trees and shrubs.  Just food for thought for some new buildings, and a new way to produce something we can use.  Thanks for everything you do!  Great game!"

61,2,"au"," Game of Wallet This game used to be awesome but they keep changing to rules and game mechanics plus offering ""quests"" and ""events"" that actually send you backwards.

It's definitely a game for those with thousands of dollars (seriously, I mean it). I know of a few that are over $5000 in spending and am told that's nothing compared to others.

It would be very difficult for a new player to start in this game and have any hope of getting anywhere near even the middle of rankings.

You basically never know when the mechanics of the game will be moved (they can be massive changes) and need to play the game near most of your waking hours."

76,1,"gb"," This game is a rip off Note it's practically impossible to enjoy this game without spending significant amounts of money. Game developers are exceptionally greedy. Also note the game is totally unfair with some player getting free upgrades without paying any money, apparently due to ""glitches"" in the game. You will regret playing this game."

82,5,"us"," Good game but.... The game itself is fun to play. My only issue is that you have to constantly buy clothes and other items to keep up a ""professional"" and ""romantic"" appearance for dates and gigs. It's starting to become very taxing and I can't buy anything that isn't worth K-stars now. Everything else that is worth cash is extremely expensive and/or locked because I'm not high enough in levels. Please consider lowering prices or creating an easier way to earn more money besides watching a million ads..."
83,5,"au"," Awesome Game!!! This game is so simple and very addictive. It's a game that you can spend hours playing. In my opinion Warriors is the best game out right now."

143,2,"gb"," Patience required Its buggy - spent about 10 times trying to log in. Surprised myself how many times I tried

A big bag of patience required for updates too. Hold your nerve and only use gems when you have to or have deep pockets

I'll play for a bit longer. Fills in the gaps whilst I'm waiting for clash of clans troop builds. If they iron out the bugs it has potential

Update to review : after playing it for a number of months playing:
Great game but it keeps crashing during a raid
Please have some stability"
144,3,"us"," Ooookkkayyyyy This is a good game I have to say, but there are a few things I don't like about the game. First it crashes sometimes which is kinda irritating, next make it easier to get gold coins to get Zeus ( I have Zeus) , next WHY THE HEAK is atom a uw1 robot!!! He should be in the same class as Zeus , and the mystery draw card thing is hard ( that is how I got Zeus ) with the gold silver and bronze. The new update came and the 4 new bots are really cool especially Fiend. There are some irritating glitches that I would like you to fix. First of all it doesn't let me play against Zeus in the free sparring mode. Next sometimes when you are at main menu it doesn't let me swipe to see different angles of my robot. Also I have fiend and when I beat Zeus in the championship mode and it shows fiend with the belt and his midsection is invisible! Weird! Plz add another update to fx These irritating problems. Thx for reading. (when is global multiplayer coming?)"

149,1,"au"," Aussies are Disadvantaged I am currently on level 53 and am totally addicted to the game. The co op I belong to are some of the nicest people I have ""met"" and we are always helping each other out. I've made a lifelong friend with an American player and when playing today and chatting to her for more than two hours she requested another helping hand. I had already sent one to her and she sent one to me at the beginning of our play. After the two hours she requested another helping hand whilst I still had a further 4 hours to wait until I could request another. How come USA players get one every two hours??? And I also discovered that once you reach 20 million coins they don't accumulate any further so basically now I sell stuff and don't get any coin for it. That's downright rude. I have spent many real dollars on this game."

152,4,"au"," Over all good game. It's a good game, however I like to make my farm look nice. I've started to 'decorate it' but I can't get any further because there is a limit on decorations? I don't understand the reasoning. I like to put paths through my whole farm, but I can only pave 1/16th of it (for example). If you like playing the game for the missions etc, then it's great, but I like playing these sorts of games to decorate. (I'm the person who plays the sims just to build and furnish the houses, I don't actually play with the people.)"

It takes about 10 minutes to load up and then keeps redirecting me to download another game when I'm click the cross! When the game eventually does start, it freezes every few seconds and doesn't let me slide up or down! The character just crashes into the posts! If it had a an update that worked that'd be great."

162,4,"us"," Good game My biggest problem with the game is that when the level is almost complete, the screen gets really dark and it's hard to see what's going on. I guess it's trying to simulate the closing of the store but it is unnecessary and a little irritating."
163,5,"gb"," Family, energy and stars Incredible game however 5 minutes is far too long to have to wait for just 1 energy it's so frustrating also it's stupidly hard to earn stars considering that is what is required to buy most things in the game also it would be incredible is the rest of the family had characters in the game"

188,5,"au"," :) Great game"
189,5,"nz"," Next Update Ideas You guy should lower prices to every thing in the game and WOULD YOU PLEASE LOWER THE UPGRADE TIME IT TAKES UP MY TIME WHEN I WANNA DO THINGS IN GAME!! Plus and more upgrades, troops and land expansion 
That would be cool. For the troops you should add stuff like a Witch Queen and a Wizard King. Also add stuff like hounds, wolves (I think), battle lions and battle tigers. Also add more defence stuff like dual cannons, x-bow like defence that shoots every 0.80s and lightning cannons that would be awesome. Please do some of these things but mainly do the ones I said at top and it would just make the game great so when my friend starts a war I can have my upgrades finished and have new things. Please do these thing.
Thx"

Barring the cost, it advances with each step that any player knows that it will become more complicated...Not in the way of normal
Games.  You have your farm, come to care for it, and therefore go forward.  You want to check it out all of the time.  Each advance
Challenges you more, as you have to remember more things to do. 

You can play at your own pace, design your own grounds, and have one HECK of a lot of fun with this game.  It must have taken YEARS to design it!!!  Trust me, try it, get rid of the first $100 bucks for the much needed, and cheaply returned, diamonds, and
Have more fun, with building challenges at your own rate.  This game is truly incredible....It is not gambling...You are on your own farm, the animals are adorable, and they switch animation during the seasons.  You work towards different levels, HOWever,
YOU achieve, not as a competitor, but by yourself...

Play the $100 right off, be patient and do not spend too many diamonds, and then play a truly quality game....CKT"

333,3,"gb"," Update crashes I like the update -not nearly so bad as some of these reviews make out. The new single square tunneling is better imo (speaking as mainly a defender the old way was always annoying) and the layout is nice. However, when I try to log on there only seems to be a 50/50 chance the game will load and the 'please wait....' messages in game still wind you up particularly mid-attack when you automatically lose the battle. Overall the update is good even if it seems to favour defense -but then why should it be easy for others to waltz in and smash your beloved dungeon to bits?"

341,4,"gb"," Good however This is a extremely very good game. The only downside of this game which infuriates me is that you have to have 3 friends with some report to be written before you enter a new case. I have no idea why you put this in but could you please take out so that if you don't have facebook you can automatially go to a new case other than that good game."
342,5,"us"," Good game! But... This game is really fun and also addicting. The reason I would have given it 4 stars is because the prices are sooo overpriced. But I figure that's not really important. But really, it's overpriced.  Other than that, good game! The characters are weird looking and why would you want to buy prince k for that much anyway? I would like maybe an upgrade for the things u get (ex. Magnets, jet pack) do it could last longer. It is also really lame for the pogo stick thing to just make it drop to the ground. I've died smacking my face into some things. Now, don't judge and say I'm a whiner, it doesn't happen too often and is not a nessecity that they need to fix. Other than that, everything fine! Sorry, I should probably stop saying that. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B> For those people who keep complaining about the game crashing, I'm not calling you whiners, but maybe your phone is bad. Before you get frustrated( again not calling u whiners just saying this just in case u might get irritated, I get irritated easily) I understand how frustrating a game crashing can be. That happened with me and terriaria mobile, but that's a different story. All I can say is, I'm playing with and iPhone 5s so that might help with the crashing. If it keeps crashing, well, just don't play it I guess. Or try this: restart your phone or double-press the home button if ur playing this on an iPhone. If u have the new iOS then find you game box and delete it by pushing it up. It won't delete the game don't worry. It'll just bring u back to the logo stuff.

•A search bar to search up things from people roadside shop
•Lower the level needed to chat with members in your neighborhood
•Possibly add snow?
•Be able to make status updates maybe to try and get people to stop asking for particular stuff
•we should be able to make a profile add customize a character to show our personality
•be able to have more extensions when you get to a certain level (for those who have run out of space on their farm)
•Be able to play this game without Wi-Fi

449,5,"nz"," Awesome, possible update ideas? Hey guys, first of all, amazing game. I would like to suggest some update ideas.
First, town hall 12-15. This will give people who have maxed out an opportunity to further progress. Along with this, a larger area to build which would mean a longer attack time to compensate for it. 
Secondly, a new troop and hero would be awesome. For a hero, a Goblin thief would be great so that the three first troops have a hero counterpart as the rest of the troops are already very powerful. Also for a troop, an idea of say a Yeti, or cavalry type troop would compensate well with the game.
Another idea would be to allow multiple people to watch a live clan war and also to be able to save replays of attacks to your iPhone/iPad/iPod memory for people who want to share attacks later. Or to upload to a YouTube channel if they wish, this would be awesome. And finally an alternate clan that is capable of holding upto 200-250 people which would be amazing for wars. Cheers!"

520,1,"gb"," Rubbish This is hopeless.  If you stop watching halfway through, it doesn't keep your place, as BBC iPlayer does.  You have to start from scratch, watch all eight, yes, eight adverts, then find where you were, watch another eight, yes, eight adverts, and only then can you pick up where you left off."
521,5,"us"," Great game! This is a great game. I enjoy trying to see how much more I can get ahead of the game.  I do wish Grandma and Grandpa would move a little faster:)"
522,5,"gb"," Awesome This game is awesome I started off in June and now my town hall is on lvl5. I really like the part of attacking where you can take loot away. I really wish we could control our troops. Supercell please add this in the next update. I recommend this game"
523,1,"us"," The WORST farming game ever, could be the BEST! Are you kidding me? And energy meter that only holds 20, so you can only do 20 things, there gone, then you can't do anything until the meter fills back up. Unless of course you want to spend a small fortune to play this game at all. If the meter was gone and you were allowed to play at will this could be one of the best farming games to play and has great graphics and items to buy. So very much potential, but you don't see Hay Day having a energy (play) meter! It's almost like you don't want people to play your game???"
524,5,"nz"," Good Awesome! If this game bet real money, could be the best!!!"
525,4,"gb"," Angry bloke Frustratingly leaves you wanting more"
526,5,"nz"," The best thing Best game ever love the farming experience!"

534,4,"us"," Suggestion I like the game. What I'd really like to do is to be able to also send out tweets. These tweets could also make other stars lose fans or gain as well as us."
535,4,"nz"," Great game but has started crashing Can't open the game today it starts loading then crashes. Also doesn't work well with game centre. I keep losing my game centre friends and it keeps asking me to log in to Game Center but then says the game centre server can't connect me."
536,5,"gb"," Another great Facebook game ported to iPad :) I was really pleased to see this game on the AppStore. I played this a lot on my laptop but don't use it so much there days, as my iPad does a lot of what I want. 

For those people that are new to the game, it is mostly a memory game, with a bit of a 'criminal' story behind it - it is not CSI! 

Yes, the energy goes down quickly but it is replenished over time. If you play daily, you get bonuses, which include orange juice and crisps that you can swap for energy if you run out. Adding friends will help in the energy department, too."
537,5,"us"," Awesome Awesome and sometimes challenging"

548,5,"au"," Addictive Awesome game :)"
549,4,"us"," Pretty Neat I agree with the review under me but I think you should be able to save the game with your email so much that you can play on different devices and I think if you find energy on different items you should be able to keep it"

556,4,"us"," iPhone 6 plus graphic out of frame Hey. I just come here to report an issue with this new update. It's good to have some new levels. Minor issue  that is the iPhone 6 plus will not show the full picture of the game. It's not severe since we can still play the game."
557,5,"gb"," Great game but watch your spending This is one bloody amazing game seriously addictive and as soon as you purchase your 1st £69.99 gold pack that's where the addiction gets worse 
I have a 220 mil account in halo k54 
If you want to be at the top 
Make sure you have a spare 5k plus around 
But apart from that it's amazing and time flys"
558,2,"gb"," Slow and lags Using iPhone 5s. It was really good before but after the update to iOS 8, it has gone really slow. Even reset my phone as a new device but the game still lags. But it's working fine on my iPhone 6. Please fix it."

560,4,"gb"," Not Bad This is still a good game despite that the levels get hard to quickly, however it is still time consuming but I Would get the paid version instead of this, it's only 69p.

564,5,"us"," Yo Great game, great app"
565,2,"us"," No good since Halloween update !!! Changed my rating to 2 stars. I'm unable to post on Facebook to receive my earned dollars and coins. The game freezes and crashes often during game play. I can only make posts on Twitter. When using my earned bucks to advance to another level, I am not given allotted amount of crowns to advance. Some when I get the rocket,my character gets hooked up in the ramps which causes me to loose. Play at your own risk and DO NOT MAKE ANY PURCHASES !!! I will NOT be playing anymore since developers will not fix these escalating issues."

570,5,"au"," Still a winner... Still loving the game, the occasional messages from KKW herself are sweet, the fashion and adventures still engaging. If we can somehow update story lines a little more frequently as once you've completed one it does feel a little like treading water...otherwise still having fun! :)"
571,3,"gb"," Good buttt Great game, but I'm lv12 and still won't let me enter fight type 1 or 2. 

And the lottery thing, fix these and it's bag on, especial for a freebie ( tho I have paid 69p for some more cards )"

Every time I look at my diamonds they are getting lower although I haven't intentionally used any?? Things are also getting really expensive and storage is very limited.

623,4,"au"," Addictive Love it. kills time when I'm bored!"
624,3,"us"," Fun but not perfect This game is very fun and addictive. It would've gotten a higher rating but for two major issues. First, there's a glitch with the credits at times which results in either awards being miscounted (winning $1000 but getting only $100 in your coins) or awards being subtracted rather than added.  This is very frustrating, especially on big wins! Second, after the last update, it's almost impossible to win no matter how high or low you bet. Winning is still possible, mind you, but you have to have a big bank to gamble with to get over that ""take everything"" hump."

641,5,"us"," Amazing!!!!!! This is the best game I have ever played on my phone it's so addicting!!!"
642,2,"nz"," Gameplay This game on IOS 7.0.4 is not up to the standard as before the update, it features special monsters like rager and scientfist coming out of no where and emerging from right behind, during the small mission of seek and destroy, in the mine I was not once but several times surprised at how fast these special monsters come up, also the game slows down a lot during shooting and sometimes the money I earn during seek and destroy, only half of it comes into the bank? What's up with that? I earned 7,043 in money but only got 4 thousand something. I know this because if I had 7 thousand I wouldn't have had to play another mission just to upgrade the tech. Please fix this :) other than that it's an amazing game"
643,5,"au"," Addictive! Too addictive but awesome!"
644,5,"au"," Doubledown Yeah great

Game"
645,4,"us"," Money maker Like some players wrote , this is a big money maker for the developers but there is s way to achieve something with very little financial input. By that I mean, whatever you to spend to get high roller in the casino. In my case it was 125$. Yep that's all I spent. I've been playing for almost a year and I'm at 350m power. Game offers events with items and gold as a reward . The key is to save whatever you have and use it in the right time. After all it a war game so you make your profits in the others.. If you want to be a ""care bear"" obviously this is not a game for you.  There  r some glitches and bugs sometimes server crash but overaly  it's really steady game. 4 stars"
646,4,"gb"," Decent Decent game really"
647,5,"us"," Omg When I do the surveys to her credits I don't get any of the credits that i earned"

651,1,"au"," Could be better I have enjoyed this app for quite some time. I understand the need to update the app but it appears that no one is actually testing the updated before it is released on us. Since the last update the app has become wildly unstable, I have lost millions of chips due to game crashes. Each of the games is now very slow and crashes often."

654,4,"gb"," New update Cairo Hey guys I didn't even receive the newest update on my iPhone 5s still yet but on the other hand I got the Cairo version on my Samsung a day before pls sort it out asap"
655,5,"au"," Criminal Case It's a really addictive game, great story line, really good game overall, however I do agree wi others the whole energy usage and having to pay money for stars, and logging in with face book is really annoying!

656,5,"us"," Fun Love this game. So much fun. Very addictive."
657,5,"us"," Glitch found!! To the left of the fishing shack there is a patch of grass that looks unfinished. Very square and seems like a overseen graphics error. Love the game, no complaints; just wanted the creators to know about the glich."
658,5,"gb"," Fantastic game I'm addicted to ds game. I think it's great. There should be other ways to earn more diamonds. And other shops to buy more items."
659,5,"au"," Great Great game"
660,4,"us"," I enjoy it It's fun"
661,5,"au"," Love It, But... I don't think that buying gold coins should be a quest. My family is poor, and we can't afford to spend money on games. On the plus side, I love the game, and the realistic animals. Btw, one of the quests tells you to grow watermelons, which cost gold coins. However, I have not found any way to earn them. Heads up, please?"
662,4,"gb"," Good game Okay I can tell you mz lots of things about what I think of this game but it would be long !! I'll do a shortened version. 

I love this game ! I've been playing for months and watched many changes been made . Some good some bad but each to their own .

First of all if new players buy a gold package maybe not jump so much . It's 2.99 then 13.99 then 35.99 then 69.99 maybe have more different offers on to let us just top our gold off.  I used to love the casino events ! Gold gold gold ! But now the stupid monster gifts are quite useless. Bring these back !! 

Also every now n then if force closes on me I'm playing on iPad 3 on a very fast connection and sometimes it force closes or becomes leggy this is not good if your under attack!  Your getting there mz just iron out more changes and your get more ppl downloading this game !! Still love not many complaints just reconsider your prices (for the poorer people) and all will be good  always loved game of war spent many sleepless nights because I'm so addicted . 

Keep up the good work"

670,4,"gb"," Great but... I play on world sulis and everyone is great. LourboyFX is my warrior and I'm loving the new places. I hope u will add boats trips from the docks to places. The thing which needs changed the most is gold drops. It needs to be higher for it takes ages to get gold at a low lvl and low lvled people needs the gold the most. Keep up the brill work ur doing. :D"

You also get energy a lot when you have full energy but nine when you need it, I keep getting only two stars on appearances because I never have enough energy and its downgrading the fans I have.
All of the hairstyles, clothes and jewellery are to be bought with stars and we never build up enough, so we can never buy anything new. 
We never have time to go on dates because there are always activities given to us so we can never fulfil getting married but overall good so far. Last thing when you are dating someone if you don't call them in one day they break up with you so you can't get married and move up the top couples list."

766,1,"gb"," Terrible Isn't the idea of games that they're meant to be fun or challenging?

Where is the fun on clicking to make a minor upgrade to a room, and then waiting a week for the upgrade to complete? 

Where is the challenge in taking the alternative approach and paying big money to make upgrades?

The original Dungeon Keeper was one of the great computer games. This version is a miserable, venal, travesty of a game."

773,3,"au"," Great game but!!! This is a great game, but it makes you have to spend heaps to get items. Most items early require gold, but later they require tickets and that just means spending more. A little disappointing I think"
774,5,"au"," Great game This game is so addictive and amazing"
775,2,"gb"," Fun for a while Fun for a while, but the novelty wears off when you realise silly items like a pair of glasses costs up to 3000, yet a job only pays you around 200 at a time. Bearing in mind that a job can take up to 8 hours and I don't have the time nor energy to complete it.

I'm an A lister, yet I can't afford to buy any luxuries. It's clearly just a ploy to try and get people to spend real money on the game.

Also, why do I have to constantly use K stars to charm my date, even when we're engaged? I've bought a wedding dress that I don't like for a ridiculous amount of money and paid a lot to keep the venue, just to end up with no K stars/money left because my date gets insecure every couple of days! What a waste!"

Second, could you add horses? Being able to ride horses would certainly  make hundreds of players joyous. Thank you for all your time and fun, and keep working on this game!

This is what happens. You have a button down when you tap on the clan castle down like where you are upgrading it. Then  when you press the button it says are you sure when you press yes you sign in for a clan tournament you get 1 hour to train troops then when two people are online and they have signed in they fight  troop vs troop.

905,5,"au"," OMG I love this game. Before I got it and the ad popped up so many times i saw the game as a terrible game that younger children would play. I eventually got sick of the ads popping up so I downloaded the game and only then I realised that I loved it and I got addicted to it. There is one slight problem though. I am on level 24 and I have just started saving to open the mine. The problem is that I need 21 000 coins to open it up. That is a big jump from the 14 000 for the boat. If these prices could come down that would be great because I am sure that not everyone has a million dollars stashed for when you have to open something. I also have a couple of suggestions, could the game be able to connect even when I have no wifi or when you don't have wifi you can't visit other farms or read the newspaper, be able to find friends not just through Facebook (because I don't have it), there be a section in the newspaper where you can search up an item that you would like and there would be all of the farms that have it on sale,have Tom all the time and not pay diamonds to get him, having cocoa beans and a chocolate machine so that you can make different types of chocolate and that when you level up you get a certain amount of things like axes,TNT,shovels, saws,nails etc. Thank you for taking your time to read my review and hopefully there are more exciting updates to come"

The only problem I have I had was I used up my diamonds (maybe around 29  diamonds) accidentally by clicking the thunder sign all the time, its mainly because I have big fingers or I m very excited to harvest all them crops, bake, loom, using the feeding machines.. Other than that it is a good family fun game! 

Rooms for improvement: Maybe try to put the thunder sign somewhere else but nearby...? :)"

I think that this game needs like a daily reward that you get every day like everyone there should be like elements of barracks or something like that oh and I think that if your base is full you can expand you land or whatever and I think there should be like a troop a lady troop that has powers of nature and that troop you can buy is right after P.E.K.A what about new SPELLS!!! There should be a rise from the dead spell that cost gold and elixirs oh and what about a lady troop that freeze whatever she hits every two hit thanks plzzzzzzz it will be a miracle"

997,5,"nz"," Please read supercell!!! 3 new ideas defence dark barracks and spell! Congrats on 2 years, I have been playing for 1 and a half years. I've gotten half my school into the game and they are, HOOKED to it. The new spell should be like a target chooser but only the troop type you choose in your attack and they all go for it. Lvl 1 you can choose 20 of the same troop to move. Lvl 2 could be 25 troops move. Lvl 3 30 troops move to the target. Make it so you upgrade your spell factory to lvl 6 but you can't add another spell, so still 5 spells max. Lab cost for upgrade 8 million. To upgrade spell to lvl 2 costs 5000000. To upgrade to lvl 3 costs 8000000 elixir. Also new dark barracks troop it can in stealth mode when on low health like 20 health. It has 500 health it takes up 15 room it's attack damage is 100 per second after it heals itself up to 100 health and can't do it again. It costs 3250000 to upgrade dark barracks and adds 15 room to it max lvl is lvl 1. It costs per troop 300 dark elixir. Also new defence, spotter short range unlocks at lvl 10 town hall max lvl 1 costs 4000000 gold and you can buy 4 and it's 2x2 room it does 15 damage per second and can affect only that dark barracks troop and pekka and golem (increase hit points of those 2 by 150) it is only single target but very good. Please please please read this supercell and consider it I hope you do. I really love playing this game!"
